## Find what living organisms occur at any given place in the world
  
Life Occurrence Explorer enables users to search for occurrences of any group of biological organisms at any locality. 

Examples of questions Life Occurrence Explorer can help answer:

* What are the kinds of birds found in my local park?
* When was this animal last reported in my area?
* When was this beetle last seen in this forest?
* What is this plant?
* What are all the plants belonging to a certain family that occur in my county?
* Where in the world can I find this type of frog?

And many more...

This tool can help anyone trying to identify an organism or see where it has been recorded.
It can therefore be used to learn and teach about nature, for citizen science and for research.

### Example: Birds occurring in Hyde Park

### List of birds occurring in Hyde Park

Life Occurrence Explorer brings together data from the biggest database of biological occurrence records [(GBIF)](https://www.gbif.org/what-is-gbif) and from the biggest collaborative geographical information project [(OpenStreetMap)](https://www.openstreetmap.org/). This enables users to explore the occurrence of living organisms on Earth in more detail and more interactively than ever before. 

* An interactive map shows where the organisms occur
* Species are listed by most to less frequent at the specified locality to facilitate identifications
* Users can filter results to quickly find specific types of organisms
* Details about each occurrence are displayed
* Images help users identify organisms

## How to use

1. Visit [gouania.shinyapps.io/occurrenceexplorer/](https://gouania.shinyapps.io/occurrenceexplorer/)
2. Enter the name of a locality. This can be broad (e.g. "Europe", "Oregon") or local ("London", "Hampstead Heath"). 
3. Enter the scientific name of an organism. Again this can be broad ("Animalia", "Mammalia", "Plantae", Aves", "Coleoptera") or more specific ("Nymphalidae", "Asteraceae", "Asplenium trichomanes subsp. quadrivalens")
4. Searching a locality returns all occurrences within the smallest rectangle containing the entire locality. The size of the rectangle can be adjusted in "Options".
5. Individual records can be selected on the map for more information
6. If you do not get results, check the "Name suggestions tab". Perhaps there are several taxa that have a similar name. Pick a correct one.
7. The Summary table gives the list of species with their number of occurrences and a link to images to help with identifications
8. The "Records" tab provides information for each individual record and a link to the full occurrence details on GBIF
9. Both Summary and Records data can be downloaded as a CSV file

### Example
##### Plants of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) occurring on the island of Corsica
